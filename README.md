**Smart City Applications: Ambulance Rescue with Intelligent Traffic Light System**

In the research, the project on ambulance rescue using an intelligent traffic light system as part of smart city applications aims to provide significant innovation in emergency services and traffic management. Increasing traffic problems and ambulance delays make it difficult for emergency patients to reach hospitals on time. The unique value of this project is the development of an intelligent traffic light system that combines cloud computing, IoT, and embedded systems technologies to rescue ambulances from traffic. This system tracks the real-time location of ambulances, controls traffic lights according to ambulance passage, and optimizes traffic flow.

The hardware used in the project includes Arduino Uno, RF sensor modules, GPS modules, and other components. The software is developed using Arduino IDE, PHP, and a mobile application. The project also includes a web-based monitoring interface.

Project management is conducted in a disciplined manner, ensuring effective communication and collaboration between hardware and software development. The wide-reaching impacts of the project are diverse, as it not only contributes to emergency services but also aims to make city traffic more efficient by improving traffic flow.

## Description:

The proposed method will significantly help both the ambulance crew and the patient in saving lives. It aims to solve the problem of ambulances being trapped in heavy city traffic. The project plans to set up an experimental environment for the development of methods, techniques, and devices. The proposed method will be prepared both in terms of software and hardware. 

Hardware-wise, IoT-based embedded systems and sensors will be used. On the software side, embedded systems will be coded, and a software solution will be developed to control traffic lights based on the ambulance's location. This will quickly create a passage corridor for ambulances in emergencies, allowing critically ill patients to reach the hospital as soon as possible.

As a result of this study, it is aimed to find a solution for rescuing the ambulance from traffic in smart cities, using a smart traffic light system based on the condition of the patient inside the ambulance and the ambulance's location. By utilizing software and IoT-based embedded systems, the project seeks to create a method that can reduce delays for ambulances and be applied in real life.

This project serves a life-saving purpose by reducing the delay for ambulances and assisting healthcare professionals, such as doctors and emergency teams, in their work. Furthermore, as one of the smart city applications, this project aims to enhance the global competitiveness of cities.
